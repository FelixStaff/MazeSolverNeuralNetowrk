# Maze-Solver-Neural-Netowrk
 - A AI that try to learn to solve an Maze

## Description
 - This repo contain
 -  - MazeDecoder
 -  - MazeCracker

### The MazeCracker
  - This cointain a Maze Generator, when you compile this .ipynb it create a MazeList.npy in the same directory.
### The MazeDecoder
  - This file have the implementation of a Decoder with feature straction and a Pix2Pix pytorch implementation to compare the progress in parallel of the 2 nets.
